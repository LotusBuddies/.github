# You’ve found the Lotus Buddies.

This is a collaborative project space mainly to promote Tzu Chi “3-in-1” media/documentation work, along with other side aspirations. Feel free to poke around.




## Flawlessly Anticipated Questions
Nobody asked, but that won’t stop us from answering.


### Why the name?

Lotus buds, lotus buddies. Nothing deep, though it certainly helps the joke that some misspellings of _buddhist_ can be erroneously autocorrected to _buddies_. (There was also a last-minute decision against `TzuChi31` for accountability reasons: better to keep things casual by doing things without the official masthead attached.)


### What does “3-in-1” mean?

**3-in-1** (三合一) is a shorthand for the media/documentation team, named for the three media: **photography** (攝影), **videography** (錄影), and **journalism** (文字).  There is also a second meaning, alluding to the the principles of **truth** (真), **compassion** (善), and **beauty** (美); that is, we aim to _truthfully_ document our works of _compassion_ and to do so _beautifully_.

What 3-in-1 _doesn’t_ mean, however, is that each one of us can do it all. We can’t! Not only is it a lot of work, the work doesn’t end when the event ends. Which is why it’s so important for us to recruit as much as possible to split the workload.


### Why is there a heavy emphasis on photography?

Practicality, given the low barrier of entry and ease of consumption.
